## by Nhu Finney
### Date: April 19, 2015
#### Description
This is a card game also called twenty-one I have done on my own by JavaScripts.

#### Setup instructions
1. Clone this git repository https://github.com/nhufinney/BlackJack_ObjectInherit_JS.git

2. Start the web app by loading BlackJack.html in your browser (or double click on the file)
(please note that when you click "start" button, please wait for few seconds until browser finishes loading "bootstrap...", otherwise it will cause a mistake by storing info from the previous game. It is because the bootstrap is called from remote sources. Sorry for this inconvenience).
